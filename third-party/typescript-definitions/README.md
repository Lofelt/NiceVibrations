# typescript-definitions

This crate is a wrapper for a fork of the third-party `typescript-definitions`
crate. The wrapper is only present to make it easier to import into other
packages (avoiding the duplication of the dependency specification),
and can be removed once a published version of `typescript-definitions`
containing the bugfix becomes available.

See `Cargo.toml` for more information.
