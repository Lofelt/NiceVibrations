This UnityPackage contains Nice Vibrations v3.9.0, the last version before the Lofelt partnership.
If for some reason you'd prefer to run this old version, just remove the current version from your project entirely, and import this UnityPackage instead.

The documentation of this old version is at http://nice-vibrations-docs.moremountains.com/
