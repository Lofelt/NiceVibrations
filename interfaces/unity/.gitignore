# Ignore the plugins that get copied after building.
# Instead of ignoring the entire NiceVibrations/Assets/NiceVibrations/Plugins/ directory, we only
# ignore the individual plugins here. That way, we can still have the .meta files in git. This is
# needed since the .meta files contain important settings, like saying that
# libnice_vibrations_editor_plugin should only be loaded in the editor.
