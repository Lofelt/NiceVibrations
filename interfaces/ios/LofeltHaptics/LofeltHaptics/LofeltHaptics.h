 @class      LofeltHaptics
 @brief      The LofeltHaptics class
 @discussion Defines the API of Lofelt SDK for iOS.

             The LofeltHaptics class is not thread safe and can only be used from
             the main thread.

             When the app is put into the background, Core Haptics will not allow
             playing any haptics. LofeltHaptics will detect this situation and cease
             all activity.
             When the app is put into the foreground again, Core Haptics will allow
             playing haptics again, and LofeltHaptics re-initalizes itself. However,
             haptics that were interrupted when the app was backgrounded do not
             automatically resume and need to be started again by calling @c play().

                                  clipped to 1.0. The amplitude is clipped hard, no limiter is used.
