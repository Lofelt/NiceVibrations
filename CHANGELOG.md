# Nice Vibrations Release Notes

## Change Log

### Nice Vibrations for Unity `4.1.2`

**17 August 2022**

##### üöÄ **Improvements**
- Fixed an output level issue on gamepads. The output level is now set after loading a clip into the GamepadRumbler.
- Fixed builds when building for tvOS. Nice Vibrations doesn't support tvOS but it was breaking the build. Now, this problem is fixed.
- When using Nice Vibrations on iPhones, sometimes haptics didn't play. And also, there was a big memory leak on iPhones. This iOS specific issues are now fixed.

### Nice Vibrations for Unity `4.1.1`

**14 April 2022**

#### üöÄ **Improvements**
- Fixes an issue where haptic clips would not import for gamepads on Apple Silicon builds of Unity.
- Fixes an issue where on Android, on some locales, PlayPreset() would fail with an error.
- Fixes an issue where Nice Vibrations didn't work at all for customers using ProGuard or R8 on Android.

### Nice Vibrations for Unity `4.1.0`

**9 February 2022**

##### ‚ú® **New features**

- Added the new "Objects" haptic samples pack by Lofelt, with 40 new haptic clips crafted with gameplay in mind.

##### üöÄ **Improvements**

- The Unity editor plugin on macOS is now supported on Apple Silicon architectures. This fixes an issue
where it wasn't possible to play rumble on Gamepads when running on Macbooks with M1, M1 Max, and M1
Pro CPUs.
- Previously, some Android devices were detecting a gamepad connected even though they didn't have any
gamepad connected. This is due to how some Android devices capabilities are interpreted by Unity's
Android player. Since Unity Input System currently doesn't support rumble on mobile for gamepads,
we disabled runtime checks for gamepads on mobile for now to avoid this problem.
- Improved performance by reducing some memory allocations.
- Android phones with basic haptic capabilities can now call `PlayConstant()`. This allows  a constant vibration to be triggered for a specified amount of time.
- Improved haptic preset playback on Android phones with basic capabilities. Previously, some presets
couldn't be felt on some devices.

##### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known issues**

- AHAP support is currently only available when using the 3.9 plugin that's included in the asset. 

### Nice Vibrations `4.0.1`

**18 November 2021**

##### üöÄ **Improvements**

- Fixed a string localization issue on iOS.
- Calling `HapticPatterns.Play()` before calling `HapticController.Init()`, was raising an exception on Android. This is now fixed.
- The build process was optimized and the post-build script was removed. The issue of not having the NiceVibrations folder in the Assets folder of the Unity project is now solved.
- Fixed text alignment issues on the Emphasized haptics tab of the Demo scene.
- Removed console warning of an unused variable when the gamepad rumble feature is disabled or when the playback requirements aren't met.

- New capabilities check API, which allows you to check at runtime the capabilities of the device.
This enables developers to make better decisions when some haptic capabilities are not available.
- Nice Vibrations 4 now allows you to play .haptic files in Gamepads and more.
